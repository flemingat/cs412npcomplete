## Approximate Solution
#### Lauren
* Specify program type in your comments (anytime, random, greedy, etc) (2 points)
 * Will use greedy algorithm
* Program runs in polynomial time (10 points)
* Program makes a reasonable approximation (6 points)
* Test cases show that approximation does not always produce optimal solution (and that the approximation "worked" as expected).
